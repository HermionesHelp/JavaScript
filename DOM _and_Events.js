/* The DOM (Document Object Model) is a set of objects that represent the browser and documents that represent the web page.

The DOM plays a key part in making web pages dynamic. Since the DOM is a JavaScript representation of the web page, you can
use JavaScript to alter the DOM and consequently, the web page. The browser will re-render (not the same as re-loading) the 
web page anytime changes are made via the DOM.
